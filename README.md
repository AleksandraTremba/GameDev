**How to play**
To play the game, you need to clone the HTTP link of this repository into IntelliJ. Gradle offers a "Gradle build scripts found" option at the bottom right, after which you have to press "Load".

First you need to start the server. To do this, go to the Server folder, from there src -> main -> java -> org -> example, where Main.java is located, which must be run.

Clients can then run the game by running DesktopLauncher.java located in the Client -> desktop -> src -> com -> gdx -> game folder.

You can move in the game with up, left and right buttons (please inform us if it is convenient for you because based on your reviews we may change it to WASD controls).

Multiplayer can be started by running DesktopLauncher several times. If an error occurs, open the white triangle to the left of the "Run" button on the top bar and "Edit configurations...". From there, "Modify options" and "Allow multiple instances".
